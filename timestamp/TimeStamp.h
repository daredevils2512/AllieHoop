 * before calling this function.
 * The SDL backend was written poorly. The problem is that the ticks
 * and the real time are not in sync, so it is possible for the milliseconds
 * to wrap before the real time is carried. (More notes are in the 
 * implementation file about this.) The SDL sync may delay the program
 * for 1 second with this call due to the sync approximation.
 * @return Returns 1 if using native milliseconds, 0 if faking it.

 * You must supply a preallocated string that the time stamp will
 * be copied into. You also must supply the buffer size of the string
 * which will be used to help prevent buffer overflows.
 *
 * My particular implementation of the library always needs a buffer 
 * that is size 24 (including the '\\0' character). However, if you 
 * substitute my implementation, this buffer size should give you 
 * some flexibility without needing to break compatibility.
 *
 * My particular implementatin returns a time stamp in this format:
 * YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS.mmm
 * 
 * @code
 * char current_time[24];
 * TimeStamp_GetTimeStamp(&current_time, 24);
 * printf("Current Time is: %s", current_time);
 * @endcode
 * 
 * @param time_stamp A pointer to a string that you want the time stamp 
 * copied into. It must have enough memory or it will be truncated.
 *
 * @param buffer_size The size of the string buffer you pass in. This
 * should include the '\\0' character.
